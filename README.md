## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on end-to-end customer segmentation analysis using a fictional retail dataset. Built entirely in Power BI, it provides valuable insights into customer demographics, spending behavior, credit risk, return rates, and target segment identification. The dashboard is designed to help businesses personalize marketing, manage returns, reduce credit exposure, and identify profitable customer groups.

Key features include dynamic DAX measures, interactive visuals (bar charts, maps, KPIs, slicers), and clear segment definitions that transform raw data into actionable business strategies.


## 📌 Problem Statement

Businesses often struggle to understand who their customers are, how they behave, and which segments drive profitability. Without a clear view of customer demographics, returns, or credit exposure, it's hard to tailor marketing, improve product offerings, or minimize risks. This project solves these problems by building a multi-page Power BI dashboard that enables deep exploration of customer data to support informed business decisions.
